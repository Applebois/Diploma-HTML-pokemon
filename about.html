First generation (1996-1999)

<img src="img\Pokeball (1).png" height="130" width="130" style="float:left; align="top" />The original Pokemon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. <img src="img\bAcunQi.png" height="200" width="200" style="float:right;"/><p>These role-playing games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the "main" 'Pokemon' games, and the games with which most fans of the series are familiar.The Pokemon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and Green for the Game Boy in Japan.When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokemon Red and Blue for international release. The original Green version was never released outside Japan.[3] Afterwards, a second enhanced remake, Pokemon Yellow, was released to use the color palette of the Game Boy Color and more of a stylistic resemblance to the popular Pokemon anime. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pokemon (in National Pokedex order, encompassing all Pokemon from Bulbasaur to Mew), as well as the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling and trading Pokemon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional Kanto region,<img src="img\384Rayquaza_Dream.png" height="200" width="200" style="float:left;"/> though the name "Kanto" was not used until the second generation. Spin-off first-generation titles include Pokemon Pinball; an adaptation of the Pokemon Trading Card Game for Game Boy Color; an on-rails photography simulator for Nintendo 64 titled Pokemon Snap; a Nintendo 64 Pokemon-themed adaptation of Tetris Attack, Pokemon Puzzle League. A 3D Nintendo 64 incarnation of the handheld RPGs' battle system, Pokemon Stadium; and a co-starring role for several species in the Nintendo 64 fighting game Super Smash Bros..[4] At the Nintendo Space World in 2000, a game was revealed briefly with Meowth and Team Rocket singing a song. This was one of the earliest introductions of the Pokemon Togepi and Bellossom. This game was called Meowth's Party, but was never turned into a playable game. Instead, the song/video was played at the end of one Pokemon episode, and a CD was made for retail in Japan for a limited time.</font>
